    <img src="https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/very_big_1/public/images/2024/07/10/untitled.png" alt="Photo of EU Ambassador" title="Charles Whiteley" height="360px">
    <p>Bangla Blockade today forced the European Union Ambassador to Bangladesh Charles Whiteley to abandon his car on Dhaka Expressway and find a CNG-run three-wheeler for a scheduled farewell meeting with Jatiya Parliament Speaker Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury.</p>
    <p>Whiteley was stuck on the expressway as students holding <mark>blockades</mark> against quota in government jobs paralysed the Dhaka's traffic today.</p>
    <blockquote>"We abandoned the car on the expressway due to protests and made it to the call on Hon Speaker by CNG -- a commemorative video made by Bernd [Deputy Head of Mission Dr Bernd Spanier], including a death-defying high-wire sequence," Whiteley said, sharing a video from his Facebook account today.</blockquote>
    <p><mark>Deputy Head of Mission Dr Bernd Spanier shot the video, depicting his journey. He partly walked the divider on the expressway and then took a CNG ride to the destination.</mark></p>
